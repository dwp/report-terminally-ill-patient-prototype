      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="what-are-special-rules"></a>What the Special Rules are for</h2>

      <p class='govuk-body'>The Special Rules allow people nearing the end of life to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>get faster, easier access to some benefits</li>
        <li>get higher payments for some benefits</li>
        <li>avoid a medical assessment</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p class='govuk-body'>These rules were previously called the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI) and applied to people who had 6 months or less to live. They have been renamed the Special Rules for End of Life (SREL) and apply to people who have 12 months or less to live.</p>

<p>Clinicians are encouraged to identify patients who have reached this stage of their life and to use a holistic approach to consider what support their patient may require. The benefit of alignment is for financial support to be included in wider conversations about ‘what matters most’ to each patient, helping to meet their individual needs.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="changes-to-special-rules"></a>Changes to the Special Rules process in September 2022</h2>

    


        <p class='govuk-body'>In September 2022 the DWP widened the eligibility criteria to include people who are likely to have less than 12 months to live. This allows them to make fast-tracked claims for:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Universal Credit (UC)</li>
            <li>Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
            <li>Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</li>
            <li>Attendance Allowance (AA)</li>
            <li>Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why the Special Rules have changed</h3>

          <p class='govuk-body'>This change has allowed the DWP to align with the current NHS/GMC definition of ‘end of life’ which states that ‘patients are approaching the end of life when they are likely to die within the next 12 months.’ </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="guidance-for-sr1"></a>Guidance for completing the SR1 form</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>Clinicians can be asked to provide medical evidence on an SR1 form to support a benefit claim made under the Special Rules.</p>




      <p class='govuk-body'>A clinician may be a:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>GP</li>
        <li>hospital consultant</li>
        <li>speciality doctor</li>
        <li>hospice doctor</li>
        <li>senior nurse (employed at Band 7 or 8, who may be working as a clinical nurse specialist, advanced nurse practitioner or similar)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Clinicians should complete an SR1 form promptly if they believe that their patient:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
 
        <li>has a progressive disease, and</li>
        <li>you would not be surprised if they were to live for less than 12 months</li>
      
    </ul>
      <p class='govuk-body'>There are no negative consequences if a patient who claims under the Special Rules lives longer than expected.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="medical-sr1"></a>Providing medical evidence using the SR1 form</h2>
<p>It’s important that you know about your patient’s condition.</p>
<p>The SR1 form asks for details of:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
 
  <li>diagnosis/diagnoses and other relevant conditions</li>
  <li>whether the patient is aware of their diagnosis and prognosis</li>
  <li>clinical features that indicate a severe progressive condition (for example, investigation results, staging if appropriate etc.)</li>
  <li>information about treatment that has been received, is ongoing or planned</li>

</ul>
<p>You do not need to give a specific prognosis. Please use language that you would normally use when communicating with other clinicians. </p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="clinical-indicators"></a>Using clinical indicators</h2>



<p class='govuk-body'>Determining life expectancy in these circumstances is not an exact science. The following indicators may suggest that a patient is eligible under the Special Rules:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <li>advanced, progressive illness</li>
  <li>worsening symptoms despite optimal treatment or management</li>
  <li>(severe) degenerative condition</li>
  <li>deterioration of incurable condition</li>
  <li>rapid decline</li>
<li>metastatic disease</li>
<li>inoperable cancer</li>
<li>severe frailty</li>
<li>death is imminent, death is inevitable</li>
<li>a high risk of sudden death with an underlying deteriorating condition</li>
</ul>
<p class='govuk-body'>Patients may be eligible for the Special Rules when receiving ongoing or palliative treatment. In some circumstances, there may not be any treatment options available that would significantly alter prognosis.</p>


<p class='govuk-body'>Your patient’s claim is likely to be helped if you include relevant information such as:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <li>no or poor response to treatment</li>
  <li>palliative care or palliative treatment in any form including palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy</li>
  <li>receiving symptom control and/or psychosocial support only</li>
  <li>no further treatment planned/available</li>
  <li>treatment is declined</li>
<li>treatment ongoing but unlikely to alter prognosis</li>
</ul>

<p class='govuk-body'>The Special Rules criteria do not only apply to patients with cancer. They also apply to other severe, life-limiting conditions, such as end stage:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <li>respiratory disease (such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis)</li>
  <li>heart disease</li>
  <li>dementia</li>
  <li>liver disease</li>
  <li>renal failure</li>
<li>neurological disease (such as advancing Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis)</li>
<li>cystic fibrosis</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

  <li>advanced Huntington's disease</li>
  <li>severe frailty</li>
 
</ul>

      <p>The DWP relies on the judgement of clinicians when they complete an SR1 form. Sometimes information needs to be clarified so you may be contacted by a healthcare professional at one of our clinical assessment providers if:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>clarification of some of the information on a SR1 form is required to help with a decision about the claim, or</li>
        <li>an individual has made a claim under the Special Rules process but has not submitted an SR1 form and clinical information is required to support the claim</li>
      </ul>
<p>Because we need to deal with these claims urgently, the healthcare professional will usually phone.</p>
