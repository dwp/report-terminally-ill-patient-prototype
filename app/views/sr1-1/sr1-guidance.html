      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="changes-to-special-rules"></a>Changes to the Special Rules process in September 2022</h2>

      <p class='govuk-body'>The Special Rules allow people nearing the end of life to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>get faster, easier access to some benefits</li>
        <li>get higher payments for some benefits</li>
        <li>avoid a medical assessment</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p class='govuk-body'>These rules were previously called the Special Rules for Terminal Illness (SRTI) and 
        applied to people who had 6 months or less to live. They have been renamed the 
        Special Rules for End of Life (SREL) and apply to people who have 12 months or less
        to live.</p>

        <p class='govuk-body'>In September 2022, the DWP widened the eligibility criteria of the Special Rules to allow 
          individuals who are likely to have less than 12 months to live to make fast-tracked 
          claims for:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Universal Credit (UC)</li>
            <li>Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
            <li>Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</li>
            <li>Attendance Allowance (AA)</li>
            <li>Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</li>
          </ul>

          <p class='govuk-body'>This change has allowed the DWP to align with the current NHS/GMC definition of 
            ‘end of life’ which states that ‘patients are approaching the end of life when they 
            are likely to die within the next 12 months.’ </p>

            <p>Clinicians are encouraged to identify 
              patients who have reached this stage of their life and use a holistic approach to 
              consider what support their patient may require.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="changes-to-special-rules"></a>The SR1 form</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>Clinicians can be asked to provide medical evidence on an SR1 form to support a benefit claim made under the Special Rules.</p>




      <p class='govuk-body'>A clinician may be a:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>GP</li>
        <li>hospital consultant</li>
        <li>speciality doctor</li>
        <li>hospice doctor</li>
        <li>senior nurse (employed at Band 7 or 8, who may be working as a clinical nurse specialist, advanced nurse practitioner or similar)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Clinicians should complete an SR1 form promptly if they believe that their patient:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
 
        <li>has a progressive disease and</li>
        <li>you would not be surprised if they were to live for less than 12 months</li>
      
    </ul>
      <p class='govuk-body'>There are no negative consequences if a patient who claims under the Special Rules lives longer than expected.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="complete-ds1500"></a>Using the SR1 form to provide medical evidence</h2>
<p>It’s important that you know about your patient’s condition.</p>
<p>The SR1 form asks for details of:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
 
  <li>diagnosis/diagnoses and other relevant conditions</li>
  <li>whether the patient is aware of their diagnosis and prognosis</li>
  <li>clinical features that indicate a severe progressive condition (for example, investigation results, staging if appropriate etc.)</li>
  <li>information about treatment that has been received, is ongoing or planned</li>

</ul>
<p>You do not need to give a specific prognosis. Please use language that you would normally use when communicating with other clinicians. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="complete-sr1"></a>Claims on behalf of patients</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>UC and ESA: only an appointee or a person who has power of attorney can make a third party claim on the patient’s behalf</li>
        <li>DLA, PIP and AA: any person representing the patient can make a third party claim on their behalf, even if the patient is unaware that a claim is being made</li>
