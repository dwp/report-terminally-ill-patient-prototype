      <p class='govuk-body'>This form is called the DS1500 form and its purpose is to tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about a patient who meets the 6-month special rules criteria. </p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>You should complete this form promptly if you believe that your patient meets the 6-month special rules criteria. The criteria are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>they have a progressive disease and, </li>
        <li>as a consequence of that disease you would not be surprised if your patient were to die within 6 months.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class='govuk-body'>The 6-month special rules criteria do not only apply to patients with cancer. They also apply to severe, life limiting cardiorespiratory and neurological conditions. this list is not exhaustive.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="benefits-that-can-be-claimed-under-special-rules">Benefits that can be claimed under special rules</a></h3>

      <p>Special rules claims can be made in the following benefits:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Universal Credit</li>
        <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
        <li>Personal Independence Payment</li>
        <li>Disability Living Allowance</li>
        <li>Attendance Allowance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your patient meets the special rules criteria, their benefit claim will be processed as a priority and in the majority of cases they will receive the highest rate of benefit.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="who-should-complete-the-ds1500-report-form"> Who should complete the DS1500 form</a></h3>


      <p class='govuk-body'>You should complete this form if you would like to encourage your patient to see which benefits they may be entitled to as part of a discussion about future care planning or if requested by your patient or their representative.</p>

      <p>This form can be completed by a registered clinician such as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a GP</li>
        <li>a hospital doctor</li>
        <li>a registered nurse</li>
      </ul>

      <p class='govuk-body'>A registered nurse needs to have acquired the expert knowledge and clinical competencies to undertake the assessment. </p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>They may be working in a role such as an advanced nurse practitioner, a Macmillan nurse, a clinical specialist nurse or a practice nurse with expertise in the management of long term conditions.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>It will not normally be necessary for you to examine the patient. You may use your own knowledge and the patient’s records to get the information you need.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>A new form, the SR1, has been introduced for patients who meet the 12-month special rules criteria for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and Universal Credit (UC).</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>For further information about changes to the special rules and completing medical reports for DWP, go to www.gov.uk and search for‘DWP factual medical reports’. </p>

      <p>For Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payment only, any person representing the patient can make a 3rd party claim on their behalf, even if the patient is unaware that a claim is being made. In this circumstance the form should be issued on request to the representative.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Determining life expectancy in these circumstances is not an exact science. This form asks for factual information and does not require you to give a prognosis. Some patients may meet the 6-month special rules criteria whilst getting treatment.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Use language that you would normally use when communicating with other clinicians. </p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>You will not face any negative consequences from the factual information you supply, for example if your patient lives longer than 6 months.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>Please visit www.gov.uk and search for ‘DWP factual medical reports’ if you would like more information regarding:</p>
