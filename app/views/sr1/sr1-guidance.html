      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="changes-to-special-rules">Changes to the Special Rules in 2022: transitional period</a></h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>From 4 April 2022, the special rules are changing from 6 months or less left to live to 12 months or less left to live.</p>
  
      <p class='govuk-body'>Due to constraints on the parliamentary timetable, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) can only change the rules for 2 benefits in 2022.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>These are Universal Credit (UC) and New Style Employment Support (ESA).</p>




      <p class='govuk-body'>There will be:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>criteria for 2 sets of special rules to consider</li>
        <li>a new medical evidence form SR1, which will operate alongside the form DS1500</li>
      </ul>
      <p class='govuk-body'>This is a transitional period until the new rules are extended to all relevant benefits from 2023.</p>

      <p class='govuk-body'>For further information about changes to the special rules and completing these forms please go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘DWP factual medical reports’. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="which-form-to-complete">Which form should I complete?</a></h3>

      <p>You should complete the DS1500 form promptly if you believe that your patient:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>has a progressive disease and, as a consequence of that disease</li>
        <li>you would not be surprised if your patient were to die within 6 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you provide a DS1500 to DWP, it will be shared across all necessary benefit platforms. You do not need to complete a SR1 form as well.</p>

      <p>You should complete the SR1 form promptly if you believe that your patient:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>has a progressive disease and, as a consequence of that disease</li>
        <li>you would not be surprised if your patient were to die within 12 months</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Your patient’s prognosis</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>It is understood that determining life expectancy in these circumstances is not an exact science and so you will not face any negative consequences from the factual information you supply, for example if your patient lives longer than 6 months.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Patients who may not know the true nature of their illness</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>When a patient asks you to complete a DS1500 or SR1 form, do not assume that they understand the special rules criteria or that these apply in certain circumstances to people with progressive, life-limiting disease.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Third party claims</h3>
      <p class='govuk-body'>For Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payment, any person representing the patient can make a third-party claim on their behalf, even if the patient is unaware that a claim is being made. In this circumstance the form should be issued on request to the representative.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><a id="benefits-under-special-rules"> Benefits that can be claimed under special rules</a></h3>



      <p class='govuk-body'>If your patient meets the 6-month special rules criteria, they can make claims for the following benefits:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Universal Credit</li>
        <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
        <li>Personal Independence Payment</li>
        <li>Disability Living Allowance</li>
        <li>Attendance Allowance</li>
      </ul>

      <p class='govuk-body'>If your patient meets the new 12- month special rule criteria they can make claims for:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Universal Credit</li>
        <li>Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      </ul>

      <p class='govuk-body'>If your patient meets the special rules criteria, their benefit claim will be processed as a priority and in the majority of cases they will receive the highest rate of benefit.</p>

    
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Who should complete the form</h3>

      <p class='govuk-body'>This form can be completed by a registered clinician such as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a GP</li>
        <li>a hospital doctor</li>
        <li>a registered nurse such as a Macmillian nurse, advanced nurse practitioner, clinical specialist nurse or practice nurse</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">This form allows you to provide further evidence to enable us to make a decision on your patient’s claim. It is not a claim form, as you cannot claim on behalf of your patients. It will not normally be necessary for you to examine the patient. You may use your own knowledge and the patient’s records to get the information you need.</p>

        <li>if we need clarification of some of the information on the DS1500 to help with our decision about the claim, or</li>
