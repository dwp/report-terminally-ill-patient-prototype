      <p class='govuk-body'>You should complete this form to support your patient's finances and to encourage your patient to see which benefits they may be entitled to. This can be done as part of a discussion about future care planning or if requested by your patient or their representative.</p>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Your patient’s prognosis
      </h4>
      <p>It is understood that determining life expectancy in these circumstances is not an exact science and so you will not face any negative consequences from the factual information you supply, for example if your patient lives longer than 6 months.</p>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Third party claims
      </h4>
      <p>For Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payment only, any person representing the patient can make a 3rd party claim on their behalf, even if the patient is unaware that a claim is being made. In this circumstance the form should be issued on request to the representative.</p>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Patients who may not know the true nature of their illness
      </h4>
      <p>When a patient asks you for a DS1500 form, please do not assume that they understand the special rules criteria or that these apply in certain circumstances to people with progressive, life-limiting disease.</p>

      <p>This form can be completed by a registered clinician such as a:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>general practitioner</li>
        <li>hospital doctor</li>

      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        A registered nurse needs to have acquired the expert knowledge and clinical competencies to undertake the assessment.
