      <p><b>The Digital Report a terminally ill patient (DS1500) service allows the form to arrive to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) instantly, which reduces waiting time for your patient. Its purpose is to tell us about a patient who meets the special rules criteria. It is not to make a claim or benefit.</b></p>

      <p>This form can be completed by a registered clinician such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a General Practitioner</li>
        <li>a hospital doctor</li>
        <li>a registered nurse</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        A registered nurse needs to have acquired the expert knowledge and clinical competencies to undertake the assessment. They may be working in a role such as an advanced nurse practitioner, a Macmillan nurse, a clinical specialist nurse or a practice nurse with expertise in long term conditions management.
      </div>

      <p>You should complete this form promptly if you believe that your patient meets the special rules criteria, namely:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>they have a progressive disease and, as a consequence of that disease</li>
        <li>you would not be surprised if your patient were to die within 6 months</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The special rules criteria do not just apply to patients with cancer. As an example, they may also apply to severe, life limiting cardiorespiratory and neurological conditions (this is not an exhaustive list).</p>

      <p>You will not face any negative consequences from the factual information you supply, for example if your patient lives longer than 6 months.</p>

      <p>Also use this service to download a copy of the information you give for your own records.</p>
